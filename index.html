                        <p>Far from being straightforward, the N244 application needs to take account of many factors
                            before submission. Furthermore, it needs to be submitted in a timely fashion and it must be
                            done right.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must have sufficient grounds to file the N244. Having “nowhere to go” is not

                                assessed your case.</li>
                            <li>The content of the N244 application must be detailed, but kept succinct. Providing
                                just enough information to get an Emergency Court Hearing. We will complete the N244
                                Application form for you to get you hearing assessed by a judge.</li>

                                you before any contact with the courts is made.</li>

                        <p>We will support you at this vital juncture to secure a positive outcome and prevent a
                            possible eviction.</p>

                            that position by calling us to get it right the first time. However, if you have already
                            lost your hearing and are looking to appeal, then by all means, please get in touch and we

                        <p>The N244 form is used by the County Court for a range of different applications. We use the
                            N244 Form to apply for an Emergency Court Hearing. This gets your case in front of a Judge
                            so they can decide on whether or not to Suspend your Eviction Notice.</p>
                        <h6>Submitting an N244 Application Form.</h6>
                        <p>An N244 Application cannot delay or stop your eviction, but if used in the right manner will
                            allow you an Emergency Court Hearing that with our help will stop your eviction.</p>
                        <p>So it’s important to get things right. Our experience means that we can complete the N244
                            Application to enable an Emergency Court Hearing that will stop your eviction order and save
                            your house.</p>

                        <h6>Acting Swiftly.</h6>
                        <p>Only if submitted to the court and completed correctly can an N244 application delay or stop
                            a repossession. And with the right legal assistance and representation in court, an
                            emergency hearing can prevent eviction. Our extensive experience with property law matters
                            means that we have the expertise to apply to the court correctly, garner an emergency
                            hearing, and stop the eviction order on your home.</p>
                        <h6>The Process</h6>
                        <p>Far from being straightforward, the N244 application needs to take account of many factors
                            before submission. Furthermore, it needs to be submitted in a timely fashion and it must be
                            done right.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must have sufficient grounds to file the N244. Having “nowhere to go” is not
                                sufficient. We will establish the grounds for you and complete your form once we have
                                assessed your case.</li>
                            <li>The content of the N244 application must be detailed, but kept succinct. Providing
                                just enough information to get an Emergency Court Hearing. We will complete the N244
                                Application form for you to get you hearing assessed by a judge.</li>
                            <li>You must have an appropriate defence. We will prepare the best defence possible for
                                you before any contact with the courts is made.</li>

                    Secured Finance is when the borrower has given their consent for a lender to place a legal
                    charge over a certain asset or assets, such as a property, a vehicle or other tangible items
                    which hold value. If the client serially defaults in payment, the lender has the legal right
                    to seize control of the asset and sell it to settle the balance of the loan outstanding.
                    There is a lower risk for a lender to offer secured finance and this should be reflected in
                    the pay rate. Lenders quite often ask for some form of security if profit margins are tight,
                    or if they want slightly more comfort with the arrangement to lend. With further security
                    and increased lender comfort, lower interest rates are acquired for our clients.

                        <p>We will firstly focus on halting any legal or court action against you, therefore stopping a
                            possible repossession or eviction going ahead, with a watertight N244 application through
                            our emergency legal defence team. Once this has been achieved and your repossession or
                            eviction has been stopped, we will advise you on several options and put in place a solution
                            that best suits you and relieve you of your fears and financial pressures. </p>
